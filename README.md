# :robot: What can this bot do? 
I made this bot for **personal use** to manage my Telegram groups. Actually, I felt like I needed someone to delete off-topic chats that people do in the public group. So the main idea came up from here! :nerd_face: 

<br>
<br>

## :hammer_and_wrench: This bot can :
- :broom: Delete a section of chats
- :memo: Take notes from people's messages 
- :pushpin: Pin a text
- ðŸ˜ˆ And have a little naughty conversation!


These features make the bot perfectly useful and simple for daily usage and groups with few members!

# :warning: Warning
This bot has a bit of an attitude!
It might sound rude or sarcastic, but trust me â€” it's just joking!ðŸ˜†<br>
Don't take it too seriously! It's meant to keep things fun!

<br>
<br>

# :speech_balloon: How does it work?
You can simply **call its name** if you want to have a conversation with it!
There is also a start command which is just for showing that how much the bot is ready to serve!
You can simply start the bot by sending `/start` in the group. It doesn't need these type of commands though. You can ask it like a member as I said before.

* This is just a **prototype** of a Telegram group-managing bot. I'm pretty sure I can add more incredible features!
